# Essential tmux commands

One of the first things we want to do is probably start tmux so we can actually use it.

So to do this, run:
```
tmux new
```
This will now enter you into a tmux session.

And now we probably want to close it so lets learn how to do that.

Type `exit` if you're in a single pane and now you'll be out of tmux. 

However there are some other ways to exit tmux so lets go through them now.

With a tmux session open you can do this to leave tmux:

Type `ctrl` + `b` then hit `d` (for detact)
