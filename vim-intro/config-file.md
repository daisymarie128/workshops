# Vim config file

When using vim it's good to spend some time setting up your config file, where you can customise the setting for vim. 

In here is where you'll define color schemes, themes, plugins, key bindings etc.

This file can be found in your root directory. To get here follow these steps:

- `cd ~` : This will move us into our root directory.
- `ls -la` : Let's list all our files including hidden and dot files.
- Check if you can see a `.vimrc` file. If you don'y have one, you'll need to creat it so type `touch .vimrc`

That's all you need to do to create your config file.

But we probably want to start customising this. There's no correct way this should look, it's all about what you prefer and what kindve environment you like.

As a handy tip theres lots of people who've uploaded their `.vimrc` files for reference on github if you ever want ideas on what to add to yours or even just use theirs. 

I don't recommend copying someones whole file if it's your first time using vim, as it can make more sense if you slowly go through the process of adding plugins and settings yourself so you know what each one is doing. But the choice is yours!
