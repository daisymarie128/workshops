# Task 1.2 - Copying and pasting

We all love a lil copy paste when we're coding. So let's leanr how to do this quickly so no one can see.

In this case our lame friend Rebecca likes to repeat everything Cindy says and Raburta likes to say only the last sentence of what Rebecca says but always ends her sentences with "God Raburta you really stink".

Task:
[ ] Don't manually type out the text.
[ ] Copy all of Cindys text into the appropriate dialouge boxes for each of the ladies.

Rebecca: 


Raburta:
